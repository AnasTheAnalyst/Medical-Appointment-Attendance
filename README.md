# Medical-Appointment-Attendance
This dataset provide a rich set of features including demographic information, health conditions, appointment scheduling details, and geographical data, which can be used to investigate patterns in patient behavior and healthcare service utilization.

**Let’s Dive into Data:**
The dataset shows clinical care, which consists of 110,527 records. The appointments were scheduled across 111 different days. The actual appointments took place across 27 different days.
The dataset covers 81 different neighborhoods and includes information on various health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, and handicaps), allowing for analysis of appointment attendance. Chronic conditions have binary values (meaning 0 for No and 1 for Yes)

**Key Findings:**
"CENTRO" and "SANTA MARTHA" show a higher concentration of all three diseases compared to others like "SÃO PEDRO" and "SANTO ANTONIO"
Within each day, appointment numbers increase in the morning, peak around midday, and then decrease towards the evening.
Wednesday and Tuesday tend to have lower overall no-show rates, while Saturday and Sunday show higher rates.
SMS reminder magnitude is slightly higher on No-show rates compared to no SMS reminder.
The combination of diabetes and alcoholism seems to have a slightly lower no-show rate compared to hypertension alone. As the number of chronic conditions increases, the no-show rate decreases.
For patients with diabetes, the no-show rate generally decreases as the appointment time moves from 6 AM to around noon, then remains relatively stable until it increases slightly towards 6 PM.
As the handicap type increases (indicating a more severe disability), the no-show rate decreases significantly.

**Recommendations**:
Optimize peak appointment times to distribute appointments more evenly throughout the day, reduce wait times, and improve patient satisfaction.
Utilize SMS reminders as an effective tool to reduce no-show rates.
Improve specialized care plans for patients with multiple chronic conditions, particularly those with hypertension.
Implement flexible staffing models to optimize resource allocation and patient care.
Provide patients with education on the importance of timely appointments, chronic disease management, and preventative care
